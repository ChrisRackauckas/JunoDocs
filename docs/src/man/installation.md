# Installation Instructions

Getting Juno takes a couple of simple steps:

## 1. Install Julia

First, download Julia (command line version) for your platform from the [downloads page](http://julialang.org/downloads/).

Then:

#### On Windows

1. Run the downloaded installer, using the default settings.

#### On OS X

1. Double-click the downloaded disk image to load it.
2. Drag the Julia-0.X.Y app onto the Applications folder shortcut.

#### On Linux

1. Unzip the downloaded folder and place it in your home directory.
2. Make sure to have dependencies curl and cmake installed.

## 2. Install Atom

Download, install and open [Atom](https://atom.io). If you have it already, make sure it's up to date (version 1.23+).

## 3. Install Juno

In Atom, go to Settings (`Ctrl+,`, or `Cmd+,` on macOS. Note that this is Control plus comma!) and go to the "Install" panel.

Type `uber-juno` into the search box and hit enter. Click the install button on the package of the same name.

Atom will then set up Juno for you, installing the required Atom and Julia packages.

### Note

You may need to add the path to Julia if it is not accessible via the command `julia`. To do so, go to Packages > Julia > Settings
and in the first box for "Julia Path" insert the path to your Julia installation (example: C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Julia-1.0.0\bin\julia.exe)

## 4. Use Juno

You should be good to go now -- try opening the REPL with Packages > Julia > Open Console or `Ctrl-J Ctrl-O` (`Cmd-J Cmd-O` on macOS) and press `Enter` to start a Julia session.
