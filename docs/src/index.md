# The Juno IDE Documentation

Juno is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the Julia language. It provides
powerful tools to help you develop code. Juno is built on Atom, a text editor
provided by Github. Juno consists of both Julia and Atom packages in order to
add Julia-specific enhancements, such as syntax highlighting, a plot pane,
integration with Julia's debugger (Gallium), a console for running code, and much more.

### Installation

To install Juno, please see the [Installation Instructions](@ref). These installation
instructions should work for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux on the current Julia release (v0.6).
If you wish to use Juno with the Julia nightly version, you may need to use the
[Developer Installation Instructions](@ref).
