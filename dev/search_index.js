    "text": "Open a console and type Juno.@enter split(\"Hello, world\", isspace). You should see something like the following (without the red annotations):(Image: debugging1)(Your arrangement of panes may be different, but if you wish you can adjust these to match.) Some of the key features of this display are annotated in red. We\'re going to walk through some of these item-by-item.The first thing to note is that a window has opened to util.jl, with a little \"bug icon\" next to it. This is a view of the source code that defines the split function you\'ve entered into. Execution is paused at the first line, a call to _split.Now turn your attention to the upper right. There are two key elements there, a control bar and a display of the next statement to be executed. Try hovering over the buttons on the control bar to get a sense for what they do (we\'ll use some of them in a minute).Notice that the \"next expression\" display does not show _split; instead, it\'s <:(String, SubString), which originates from a portion of that first line, in the source written as T <: SubString. (T is a type parameter, the type of str which here is String.) This is an indication that before calling _split, we have to do a bit of preliminary work.In the control bar, find the button for \"Next Expression\" and click it. While the line in the source code display (the pane with util.jl) doesn\'t change its location, you can see an update in the next expression to be executed, now apply_type(SubString, String), meaning it will be executing the SubString{T}.Continue to press \"Next Expression\" until the call to _split is queued up. Then press the button just to the right, \"Step into Function\". Now you\'ll see a change in the source window, a jump to a new execution point within _split.Now let\'s turn our attention to a few other elements. The \"Callstack\" pane to the right should show a chain of calls; the first one (the one we entered) is at the bottom, and the current one is at the top. In this particular case you\'ll note a strange entry, something along the lines of #split#328 (the specific number may be different for you). This is revealing some of the internals of how Julia handles functions that have keyword arguments. To keep things from getting too tedious, the debugger stepped over some of the preparatory steps needed to construct the appropriate keyword arguments, but you can see the evidence in the callstack.Below the Callstack pane is a very important pane, \"Breakpoints.\" Breakpoints allow you to skip over many lines without stepping, and then stop at a particular line. You can set breakpoints in the console using the commands implemented by JuliaInterpreter, but perhaps easier is to click in the leftmost column (you\'ll need to run using Revise prior to this). You\'ll see this location gets added to the list (previously empty) of breakpoints on the right hand side.(Image: debugging2)Up in the Debugger control bar, click the double-arrows indicating \"Continue.\" You should see the execution jumps to the position of the breakpoint; the values of variables in the Workspace plane also update to reflect the new state.In the Breakpoint panel, here are some fun things to try:uncheck the box next to this breakpoint location; you should see the red dot to the left of the source line dim. This is an indication that you\'ve disabled this breakpoint; it hasn\'t been forgotten, but you\'ve made it inactive (the fact that it hasn\'t been forgotten can be especially useful in conjunction with conditional breakpoints, discussed next). Click the box again to reactivate it.\nclick the icon that looks like a fork in the road (\"Edit Condition\"). A dialog should open asking you to insert a breakpoint condition. The workspace indicates that j has a value of 7; type in j > 8 and click \"Confirm.\" Note that the icon next to that source line has turned blue, indicating a conditional breakpoint. Given the condition on j you entered and the fact that the input string does not have any spaces at positions higher than 7, this breakpoint would not have been hit.\nTo try out your new conditional breakpoint, first exit debugging by clicking the \"x\" in the Debugger control bar. Your console should return to the normal julia> prompt; now, enter Juno.@run split(\"Hello there, world\", isspace), where @run is like @enter followed by clicking \"Continue\". You\'ll return to the breakpoint, but now j==13 and the first substring, \"Hello,\" has already been entered into strs. This demonstrates that you already completed the first iteration of this while loop before the condition was satisfied.\nExit debugging again and click the \"Clear Breakpoints\" Check the \"Break on Exception\". Then enter an expression that would normally trigger an error: Juno.@enter convert(UInt, -8). (You can\'t convert a negative number to a UInt.) Click \"Continue.\" You should advance to a method, throw_inexacterror. Examine the Callstack pane to see the chain of calls that got you here.This isn\'t an exhaustive overview of debugging in Juno, but hopefully it\'s enough to help you get started exploring on your own."

    "text": "Juno\'s inline display system operates on three distinct levels:If you create a new type and don\'t define a show method for it, Juno will use a fallback that lazily shows all fields.\nIf you\'ve defined a show method for the application/prs.juno.inline MIME type then Juno willdisplay what is printed by that method or\ndisplay the above fallback for the object returned by the show  method.If you\'ve defined a show method for the text/plain MIME type Juno will use that to create a simple Tree View.\nTreeViews.jl allows customizing everything about how your type is displayed.The following will show how to use the TreeViews.jl API for pretty-printing in a few simple cases.First, let\'s define some custom types we want to display:struct Foo\n    field1\n    field2\nend\n\nstruct Bar\n    a\n    field1\nendBy default, Juno displays those like this:(Image: custom rendering 1)This default rendering method will not be used if you define e.g.Base.show(io::IO, ::MIME\"text/plain\", ::Foo) = print(io, \"Foo\")for displaying this nicely in the REPL. If you also define a Base.show(io::IO, ::MIME\"application/prs.juno.inline\", ::Foo) method, that will be used instead. As a special case, you can also return an object from that show method, and Juno will show that with its default display methods (which allows you to recover what is shown above):Base.show(io::IO, ::MIME\"application/prs.juno.inline\", x::Foo) = xTo switch to a TreeViews.jl display we can simply overload the following methods for our types:import TreeViews: hastreeview, numberofnodes, treelabel, treenode\nhastreeview(::Foo) = true\nhastreeview(::Bar) = trueSince TreeViews.jl implements sensible defaults for custom types, this gives us(Image: custom rendering 2)It is of course possible to customize this to your heart\'s content. For example, we might only want to display Foos first field withnumberofnodes(::Foo) = 1or change the Foo in the first line to something else:treelabel(io::IO, x::Foo, ::MIME\"text/plain\") = print(io, \"I\'m a Foo.\")(Image: custom rendering 3)Juno accepts a few different MIME types:text/plain: Probably best compatibility.\ntext/html: Allows much richer display options (e.g. LaTeX).\napplication/prs.juno.inline: Same as text/html, but specific to Juno.Even text/plain allows for some (limited) control over styling (colors, decorations). In general, you can print the correct SGR codes and everything will work, but I\'d recommend using Crayons.jl or a similar library instead:# plain SGR\ntreelabel(io::IO, x::Foo, ::MIME\"text/plain\") =\n  print(io, \"\\x1b[32mHello\\x1b[0m there\")\n\nusing Crayons\ntreelabel(io::IO, x::Foo, i::Int, ::MIME\"text/plain\") =\n  print(io, crayon\"(250,20,105) bold\"(\"General\"), \" Kenobi\")(Image: custom rendering 4)note: Note\nThose styles also apply to display in the REPL, provided for example by the as-of-yet unregistered REPLTreeViews.jl package:(Image: repl tree views)Using text/html allows for greater customization by using inline CSStreelabel(io::IO, x::Foo, i::Int, ::MIME\"text/html\") =\n  print(io, \"<span><span style=\\\"color:aqua; font-size:0.7em\\\">General</span> Kenobi</span>\")(Image: custom rendering 5)The application/prs.juno.inline MIME type allows you to make use of the styling Atom uses:treelabel(io::IO, x::Foo, ::MIME\"application/prs.juno.inline\") =\n  print(io, \"<span class=\\\"syntax--support syntax--type syntax--julia\\\">Junoooooooo!</span>\")(Image: custom rendering 6)It\'s also possible to e.g. print no label for Foos first field and handle everything in with treenode:treelabel(io::IO, x::Foo, i::Int, ::MIME\"application/prs.juno.inline\") = print(io, \"\")\nusing Markdown\ntreenode(x::Foo, i::Int) = MD(\"\"\"\n    ## Markdown\n\n    with ``\\\\LaTeX``\\n\n    and `code = 2+sqrt(4)`\n    \"\"\")(Image: custom rendering 7)To hide the treenode display, simply return missing:treenode(x::Foo, i::Int) = missing\ntreelabel(io::IO, x::Foo, i::Int, ::MIME\"application/prs.juno.inline\") = print(io, \"...\")(Image: custom rendering 8)Nothing at all will be shown if treelabel doesn\'t print anything and treenode returns missing."

It simply evaluates whatever it\'s given and returns the result â€“ in this case, 4.Often we want to do something with that return result in Atom â€“ in this case, we\'d like to display the result. We don\'t need to change anything on the Julia side to accomplish this; we can just use the rpc function from JS:client.rpc(\'eval\', \'2+2\').then (result) =>\n  console.log dataThis call sends the eval message, pulls the result field out of the returned JSON, and displays the result, 4, in the console.This approach is exactly how Atom gets evaluation results, autocompletion and more from Julia â€“ so it\'s easy to find more examples spread throughout the julia-client and Atom.jl source code.As a first project, try implementing an Atom command (see the Atom docs) which sends this message to Julia, as well as adding the Julia handler above to Atom.jl.

Modifying say, the completions handler in a similar way will show you what completion data Julia sends back to Atom (there will probably be a lot, so try looking at specific keys, for example).You don\'t need to reload Atom or restart the Julia client every time you make a change like this. If you open a file from the Atom.jl source code, you should see from the status bar that Juno knows you\'re working with the Atom module (try evaluating current_module() if you\'re not sure). Evaluating handlers from within the Atom module will show you what message types are currently defined. If you change a handler, just press C-Enter to update it in place; you should see the effect of your update immediately next time the handler is triggered. For example, if you modify the eval handler as follows:handle(\"eval\") do data\n  println(data[\"code\"]) # <- insert this line\n  # ...and update it, you should find that the next time you evaluate you see the contents of the current editor dumped into the console. Thus, most features or fixes you\'d want to add to Juno can be made without a long edit â€“ compile â€“ run cycle."
